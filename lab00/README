lab0.c: This C source program accepts 4 optional arguments. It takes the contents of "input" (stdin) and copies it into "output" (stdout) with the help of file descriptors. 4 arguments:

	--input=filename -> use filename as standard input
	--output=filename -> use filename as standard output (creates new file if it doesn't exist).
	--segfault -> forces a segmentation fault
	--catch -> creates a SIGSEGV handler to catch any segmentation faults
	--coredump -> dumps core on segmentation fault

Makefile: Contains the following targets
	  default: takes lab0.c and builds the executable with special flags.
	  check: runs a smoke test on the executable
	  	 exitTest: tests for the correct error code upon a successful exit of the program. Input file created and correctly specified.
		 argTest: tests for the correct error code upon the input of an incorrect argument.
		 equalityTest: tests for equality between input and output file upon being given correct input and output arguments.
		 segTest: tests for a segmentation fault upon being given the --segfault option
		 existTest: tests for the correct error code upon being given a specified input file that does not exist.

	  dist: creates the distribution tarball with relevant files.
