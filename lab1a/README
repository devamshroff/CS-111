File Implemented: simpsh.c

This is the first of a 3-part implementation of simpsh.c that supports the
following features:
	  --rdonly: through which read-only files are opened and saved
	  	    for future use by --command.
		    
 	  --wronly: through which write-only files are opened and saved
	  	    for future use by --command

    limitation for both rdonly and wronly: inability to remove a file
    	       from the list of file descriptors after it has been added.
	       
	  --command:
		limitation:
			-unable to wait until a command finishes
			-unable to support piping where the result of one
			command is "piped" into another 
		
	  --verbose: just outputs all options and arguments that come after it
	  	     limitation: unable to turn verbose off so that some of the
		     options aren't printed
		
  I think a useful option to add would be one that returns a list of all the
  currently open file descriptors for viewing and adding options that support
  the manipulation of the fd_array
